# Git commands
## GIT CHEAT SHEET


### Most used ###

1. **Check the status of your changes**: Before uploading changes, it's good practice to check which files have been modified. You can do this using the `git status` command. Open the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code and run:

    ```bash
    git status
    ```

    This will show you the modified files and those ready to be uploaded.

2. **Add changes to the staging area**: You need to add the modified files to the staging area before committing. You can do this with the `git add` command. If you want to add all modified files, you can use:

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

    If you only want to add specific files, you can list them individually.

3. **Commit the changes**: After adding the files to the staging area, you need to commit the changes with a descriptive message using the `git commit` command. This saves the changes to your local repository.

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Descriptive message of the changes"
    ```

4. **Push changes to the remote repository (GitHub)**: Finally, to send the changes to your GitHub repository, you need to use the `git push` command.

    ```bash
    git push origin <branch_name>
    ```

    Make sure to replace `<branch_name>` with the name of the branch you are working on.
